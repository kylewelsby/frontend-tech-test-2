# SamKnowns Frontend Code Challenge

## 2020-08-07 17:00:00
Starting with getting boiler plating a project using Vite.
You might notice the re-organisation of the challenge source files to `./__DESIGNS__` and `./src/utils/flatten.js` which feel like an ideal place for them in the project right now.

The project uses Vue.js with the opinionated Vite builder for simplicity. 

Now I'm going to get the basic functionality of the project running.  My intent is to use [XState.js](https://xstate.js.org/) and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)

Committed base skeleton

Wiring up the API to finalise the core functionality, then quickly finish off the design to keep the core ability within given time allocation.

Implemented the design as provided in the `.png` and ensured it is reactive with best intentions. 

Now let's take on the challenge of the `src/utils/flatten.js` project.

Introduced Jest unit-testing framework to test the expectations for `src/utils/flatten.js`.  Refactored the code to use reducers and checks for objects.

Adding final touches like a `./README.md` and ensuring the quality of the resulting code at this time is as I expect. 

Should I have had more time time I would have liked to use [XState.js](https://xstate.js.org/) to manage the state machine of the API requests and seperate the main component out into smaller focused components on the off-chance they'll benifit from reusability. 

For now everything for this simple example is in one document to keep the state management simple.
